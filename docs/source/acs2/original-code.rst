Original code
=============
The original author's code is located in ``assets/original`` directory.

However it was written in 2001 when C++ was quite different than now. For that reason a slightly changed version (syntax) working on nowadays compilers can be found in ``assets/ACS2``.

To compile the sources type (inside ``assets/ACS2``)::

  make

And to run it::

    ./acs2++.out <environment>

For example::

    ./acs2++.out Envs/Maze4.txt
